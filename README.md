This repository demonstrates a common error in R when creating data frames: inconsistent column lengths. The `bug.r` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.r` provides the corrected version.  The error arises because `data.frame` expects all vectors to have the same length. The solution involves ensuring all vectors have consistent lengths before creating the data frame.
